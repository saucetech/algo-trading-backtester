# algo-trading-backtester

The goal of this project was to implement machine learning models and backtesting algorithms in a Google Colab notebook to find the optimal algorithmic trading strategy between a machine learning model and a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy for any stock or crypto asset. We first determined the optimal SMA window pairs that would provide the highest net profit and/or Sharpe ratio for a SMA crossover algorithmic trading strategy by backtesting a variety of moving average window pairs using Gridsearch from sci-kit learn. We then compared the results of this backtest to a machine learning SVM model to see which outperformed the other, if any.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7 in Google Colab with the following libraries:
- pystan
- fbprophet
- hvplot
- holoviews
- fastquant
- streamlit
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation Guide

To use this notebook, simply open the Google Colab notebook and run the notebook.
